A visual communication app for kids with autism which will focus on daily necessities that will help children learn how to express and manage their everyday needs using images and simple visuals. The app might include a set of icons or illustrations representing common activities such as eating, dressing, brushing teeth, and ways of expressing their emotions. These visuals will allow kids to organize their routines, communicate with parents or caregivers, and express their feelings about daily tasks. For instance, a child might tap an image of a toothbrush to signal its time to brush their teeth, or select a picture of an expression to show that they are tired. Additionally, the app may include simple educational games that will help them learn. By using easy-to-understand visuals, the app will aid communication skills, independence, and routine-building for young children in a fun, engaging way. The app will feature two mode, child mode and a Parent mode. In Parent Mode, parents can easily upload their child’s preferred foods, activities, and daily living needs through simple file uploads. This customization allows the app to reflect the child’s unique preferences, helping to create a more personalized and familiar experience that supports their daily routines and communication.


## Child Mode ##

# Daily Living:
The app features simple, visual icons for essential daily tasks, helping children communicate their basic needs like eating, drinking, sleeping, and personal hygiene. Kids can select pictures representing these activities—such as a plate for meals, a water glass for drinking, or a bed for sleeping—to indicate their needs. This helps children with limited verbal skills express their routine requirements, fostering independence and self-care. 

# Emotions:
Understanding and expressing emotions is key for young children, and the app helps in this area by providing a range of emoticons or images that represent different feelings—happy, sad, angry, tired, or excited. Children can tap on the emotions that match how they’re feeling throughout the day, allowing them to communicate their mood even when they struggle with words. This visual approach helps improve emotional literacy, encourages self-awareness, and gives parents insight into how their child is doing emotionally. It’s also a great tool for teaching empathy and helping children understand the emotions of others.

# Recreational Activities:
To keep the app engaging, it includes visual icons for recreational activities like playing, drawing, listening to music, or watching a favorite show. Kids can plan their playtime or select activities that they enjoy doing in their free time, helping them balance relaxation with other tasks. The app might also feature interactive games, creative tools for drawing, coloring, or crafting, giving children opportunities to express themselves in fun and imaginative ways. These recreational features not only support creativity but also provide a healthy outlet for relaxation and enjoyment during the day.

## Parent Mode ##

Parental Control is a key feature in a kids visual communication app, ensuring that both children and parents have a safe and manageable experience. These controls provide parents with the ability to monitor, and customize the app's use to suit their child's needs, making it both secure and effective. Here’s how parental control typically works:

# Customization:
Parents can customize the app with images of their child’s favorite food, preferred clothes, and favorite activities. 
Uploading personalized visuals or photos of the child’s specific environment (e.g., their own toothbrush, their bed) to help create a more familiar experience. They can modify or add new visual icons to reflect their child’s specific needs, ensuring routines are always relevant and personalized.

# Emotion Tracking: 
Parents can upload or choose from a set of emotions, allowing the child to communicate their feelings more effectively. Parents can also track emotional trends to understand the child’s moods and needs over time.

# Task Monitoring:
The app will show emotional, nutritional and activity updates, or even how the child is interacting with the recreational features. This helps parents assess their child’s emotional well-being and daily routines.


In summary, this  visual communication app helps children express daily living, emotions, and recreational activities, into a user-friendly experience that helps children better understand their daily routines, communicate their feelings, and have fun with parental controls for safety.
